### Fleet course correction (drone) in C (raylib)

- Custom algorithm for autonomous fleet control and course correction in a master slave setup.
- For sake of demonstration, fleets in this contex represents a network of drones.
- In a Master-Slave system, the master or lead drone controls the following characteristics of the entire network based on its position, speed and direction
    - the course
    - the direction
    - the speed 
- Has preconfigured flight patterns by default for testing the algorithm.

- Also comes with a nice user interface for configurations
